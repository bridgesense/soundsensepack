# soundsensepack
This is an alternate soundpack for [SoundSense-rs](https://github.com/prixt/soundsense-rs).

This pack works with the new sounds produced for version 50 of
Dwarf Fortress. *This pack **does not** contain copyrighted sounds 
from the game*. The purchaser of the game is responsible for  
providing them.

## How to install
1. Clone this repository where the soundsense-rs executable is located.

```
cd soundsense-rs
git clone https://github.com/bridgesense/soundsensepack.git pack
```

2. Copy the sound directory from DF 50 to the pack directory.

This is a fork of [Jecowa's repository](https://github.com/jecowa) with a few tweaks.
