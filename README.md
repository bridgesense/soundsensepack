# soundsensepack
This is an alternate soundpack for [SoundSense-rs](https://github.com/prixt/soundsense-rs).

This pack works with the new sounds produced for version 50 of
Dwarf Fortress. *This pack **does not** contain copyrighted sounds 
from the game*. The purchaser of the game is responsible for providing them.

## How to install
1. Clone this repository where the soundsense-rs executable is located.

```
cd soundsense-rs
git clone https://github.com/bridgesense/soundsensepack.git pack
```

2. Replace the sound directory with the one from your DF 50 installation.

![copy the sound directory over to this soundpack](https://github.com/bridgesense/soundsensepack/blob/master/replace-sound-directory.png?raw=truereplace_sound_directory.png)

This is a fork of [Jecowa's repository](https://github.com/jecowa) with a few teaks:
* The weather tracks have all been tapered for a less jarring background ambiance.
* More music and sound references have been added from DF 50.
